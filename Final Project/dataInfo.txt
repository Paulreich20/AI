Project Overview:
Our project is an improvement on the previously built binary decision trees based using the ID3 algorithm. We've
added the possibility to account for any number of classes/decisiones, implemented ten-fold cross validation and
an added file that performs cost complexity pruning on the tree, which can be summarized as follows:
    1. Create the tree T
    2. For all possible subtrees S of T:
        -Prune S, calculate the error of the resulting tree, Prune(S,T).
        -Find T_i with the smallest error where T_i = Prune(S,T)
        -Add T_i to list
    3. Go to 2 if T_i is not just the root
    4. The most accurate tree in the list is the resulting pruned tree.


To run:
    Data files are in the same format as they were for our assignment, except values are separated by COMMAS not TABS.
    The first row contains category names for each column, the last column is the class/decision value.
    Non-pruning:
        python3 final.py [data file]

    Pruning:
        python3 pruning.py [data file]

    Outputs the tree using the entire input file as a training set, followed by cross-validation data.

We've included two datasets found on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php:
    -zoo.data provides an easy to understand visualization of the tree output although is too narrow to produce
     results after pruning.
    -cmc.data: shows significant changes during pruning.

cmc.data
------------------------------------------
This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women
who were either not pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview. The problem is to predict the current
contraceptive method choice (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based on her demographic and
socio-economic characteristics
